We will practice Bayesian estimation for hierarchical linear models and regressions with random effects. The dataset has the following variables:

ConsumerID:   	ID's of the sampled consumers
History:	How long (number of months) the customer has been using the card before the experiment
Income:	The customer's annual income
WalletShare:	The card's share of wallet in the consumer's total monthly spending    
Promotion:	Index of monthly promotion activity â€“higher index indicates more pomotions
Balance:	The customer's unpaid balance at the beginning of the month
